  description: "We proposed an adaptive curriculum-based RL algorithm that reveals partial rationales based on per-sample learning estimation of the value of a state. We demonstrate — both empirically and theoretically — a separation result: on complex reasoning tasks, neither SFT nor vanilla RL generalizes with increasing complexity, while AdaBack enables gradual abstraction learning — without ever fine-tuning on full demonstrations.
